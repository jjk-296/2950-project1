These datasets were selected because they included data (collectively) from around the time range we were looking for (early 2000’s to around current day), and because they all had extensive data on the changing prices of the respective stocks/indexes and box office revenue, as needed to properly analyze our research questions. Regarding these three raw data files, below includes a documentation of all the steps we took to turn those files into the analysis-ready datasets needed for our final project.\n",

    "For the above dataset, we used the pandas to_datetime method to convert data from the “Date” column to the date type for easier future manipulation of this data. We assigned new “Year” and “Month” columns for the respective year and month data, then used pandas to only show data from after the year 2001 (starting from 2002) as that fits the time interval we will examine for our analyses. We then cleaned our dataset using the SQL SELECT function to only select “Date”, “Close” and “Year” in the cleaned dataset as these are the only values we will be observing, as shown below. We chose to select “Close” (which is how much the S&P 500 index price was at the close of that specific stock market day’s closing) among “Open”, “High”, and “Low” as we believe it is relatively representative of the overall performance of the index price for any given day."

    "Netflix Daily Stock Prices: The dataset we selected is about Netflix’s daily stock prices from 2002 to 2021. The columns of the dataset include the date, low, high, open, close, volume, and adj close for the Netflix stocks. While date, high, low are self explanatory, the open column is  the starting period of trading on a securities exchange or organized over-the-counter market, the close is the last price at which a stock trades during a regular trading session. The volume is an indicator of market strength, as rising markets on increasing volume are typically, and the adj closing price amends a stock's closing price to reflect that stock's value after accounting for any. There are 4,881 instances in total, and we decided to focus on one column of the data, which is the close price of the stocks and used data from 2002 to 2020, which is 4,686 instances, because the other dataset we are using has data until 2020. The data most likely contains all instances and is not a sample, but there may be some missing instances in the middle. All the data is directly related to Netflix’s stocks and is self-contained. There is no confidential or offensive information in this data as it does not pertain to a specific subgroup and the individual instances are not people but are prices. Past uses of the data include predicting future stock prices of Netflix and mostly using it for research about economics, stock markets, and finance. \n",

    "Box Office Revenue: The data shows international, domestic, worldwide box office revenue for the top 600 movies of all time. (Note: Box office revenue doesn’t include DVD sales or streaming.) The columns include the title of the movies, the release year, and the international, domestic, and worldwide box office revenues. The domestic box office revenue will be US revenue, international would be revenue from countries outside of the US, and worldwide would be the total revenue globally. There are 600 instances in total as the dataset collects data about the top 600 movies with the highest revenue from 1940-2020. The data is not a random sample, but is a sample of the top 600 movies, and is comprehensive without missing data but it does not contain data about movies with lower revenue than those in the top-performing list of 600. We decided to focus on data instances from 2002 to 2020, which would be 454 instances, because the Netflix dataset starts from 2002 and our S&P 500 dataset collected data until 2020. All the data is directly related to the box office revenue and is self-contained.

    "S&P 500: The S&P 500 data is a stock market index tracking the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. We decided to use this data in order to verify if the changes in box office revenue prices were actually affected/caused by the Netflix stock prices or if they were just showing a correlation. The columns of this dataset include the Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume like the Netflix dataset. We decided to use the data from 2002 to 2020 only, and that would be 4,745 instances out of 23,324.

There is no confidential or offensive information in this data as it does not pertain to a specific subgroup and the individual instances are not people but are prices. Like the Netflix dataset, past uses of the data include predicting future stock prices and economic trends of the United States, and research in areas such as business, economics, stock markets, government, and finance.\n"

    "**Data Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of our data is that we chose to examine correlations between worldwide and domestic box office and Netflix stock prices in an effort to analyze the effect of streaming services on box office success, but not every country uses Netflix as a primary streaming service. While Netflix is the largest streaming company in the world (~225 million subscribers worldwide), there are a number of other prominent streaming services that will not have been accounted for, such as HBO, Hulu, and Disney+. Thus, only accounting for Netflix in our data, while likely representing the overall impact of streaming services on box office successes in the general sense, may not entirely properly represent the impact of streaming services as a whole. Moreover, our first two research questions observe data from the Netflix stock price and box office revenue datasets without accounting for inflation as due to it, stock prices would see a general increase over the years. However, in order to account for this and deeper dive into the effect of the overall economy on box office revenue and the overall status of movie theaters’ success, our third research question attempts to explore this exact relationship so that our readers will ideally have more accurate context of the economic status of the U.S. so that they can better understand the data analyzed for our second research question. Furthermore, our box office revenue dataset only lists out data for the top 600 best-performing films from 1950 to 2020 and thus doesn’t include data for all films in this time period, meaning this dataset doesn’t contain collective box office revenue for all films and therefore isn’t perfectly representative of the entire movie theater or box office revenue. Furthermore, given that stock prices were recorded by day whereas box office revenue was accumulated for each movie per their release year, we will have to aggregate the data to match one another for any meaningful analysis."
